Java advance monitoring and performance tuning settings to be applied in Java Application Server startup files. Works for both Tomcat and Wildfly.

### 1. Java OPTS for JMX
Java Management Extensions (JMX) is a Java technology that supplies tools for managing and monitoring applications, system objects etc. Those resources are represented by objects called MBeans (also called Managed Bean).

```java
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote 
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=6000 
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false 
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false 
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.rmi.port=6001 
-Djava.rmi.server.hostname=192.168.1.1
```
Once the settings are in place, we can use JConsole tool to monitor the server.

### 2. Java OPTS for GC Log
Garbage Collection GC tuning is the process of adjusting the startup parameters of your JVM-based application to match the desired results. Itâ€™s crucial for the garbage collector to work as efficiently as possible. The GC process can be heavy. Settings for capturing Garbage collection logs is mentioned below.

```java
-verbose:gc -Xloggc:/home/centos/gc.log.'date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S' -XX:+PrintGCDetails -XX:+PrintGCDateStamps -XX:+PrintGCApplicationStoppedTime
```

Once the log is captured, we can use [GCEasy.io](https://gceasy.io/) to analyse the output.

### 3. Java OPTS for Heap Dump
Modern applications waste memory because of several reasons: Duplicate String, Duplicate Objects, Inefficient Collections etc. Heap dump can be used to detects those inefficiencies.

```java
-d64 -server -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError -XX:HeapDumpPath=/tmp/heap -Djava.util.Arrays.useLegacyMergeSort=true
```

Once the log is captured, we can use [Heaphero.io](https://heaphero.io/) to analyse the output.

### 4. Thread dump
A thread dump is a snapshot of the state of all the threads of a Java process. The state of each thread is presented with a stack trace, showing the content of a thread's stack. A thread dump is useful for diagnosing problems as it displays the thread's activity. Thread dumps are written in plain text, so we can save their contents to a file and look at them later in a text editor.

#### Thread dump using `jstack`
```
jstack <java-process-id> > /tmp/threaddump.txt
```
Once the thread dump is captured in a file, we can use [FastThread.io](https://fastthread.io/) to analyse the output.
