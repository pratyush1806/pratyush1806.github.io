### What is Varnish Cache
Varnish is a reverse HTTP proxy, sometimes referred to as an HTTP accelerator or a web accelerator. A reverse proxy is a proxy server that appears to clients as an ordinary server. Varnish stores (caches) files or fragments of files in memory that are used to reduce the response time and network bandwidth consumption on future, equivalent requests. Varnish is designed for modern hardware, modern operating systems and modern work loads. Varnish is more than a reverse HTTP proxy that caches content to speed up your server. Depending on the installation, Varnish can also be used as:

1. web application firewall, 
2. DDoS attack defender, 
3. hotlinking protector,
4. load balancer,
5. integration point,
6. single sign-on gateway,
7. authentication and authorization policy mechanism, 
8. quick fix for unstable backends, and
9. HTTP router.
