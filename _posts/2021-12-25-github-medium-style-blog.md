Steps to generate your own custom Blog using Github pages and Mediumish template. Mediumish template is built with Jekyll static site generator tool which has built-in support for GitHub Pages.

### How to use Github Pages to create your own Blog
GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website. The default domain used is GitHub's github.io domain. To publish a user site, you must create a repository owned by your user account that's named `<username>.github.io`.

### Creating a repository for your site
1. In the upper-right corner of any page, use the  drop-down menu, and select New repository.

2. Use the Owner drop-down menu, and select the account you want to own the repository.

3. Type a name for your repository and an optional description. If you're creating a user site, your repository must be named `<username>.github.io` .

> Tip: If index.html is present, this will be used instead of index.md. If neither index.html nor index.md are present, README.md will be used.

6. To see your published site, under "GitHub Pages", click your site's URL.
